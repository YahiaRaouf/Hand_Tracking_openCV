# Hand Tracking using OpenCV and Mediapipe

## Overview
This project demonstrates real-time hand tracking using **OpenCV** and **Mediapipe**. It detects and tracks hand landmarks in a video stream, allowing you to visualize the hand's key points and connections. The project is implemented in Python and can be used as a foundation for gesture recognition, virtual mouse control, or other hand-based interaction systems.

## Features
- **Real-time Hand Detection**: Detects hands in a live video stream.
- **Landmark Visualization**: Draws hand landmarks and connections on the video feed.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust detection confidence, tracking confidence, and the number of hands to detect.
- **FPS Display**: Shows the frames per second (FPS) for performance monitoring.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- Mediapipe (`mediapipe`)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:YahiaRaouf/Hand_Tracking_openCV.git

2. Run main.py file
3. The application will open a window showing the live video feed with hand landmarks and connections drawn on the detected hands.
4. Press `q` to exit the application.
